<h1>Let&#39;s Get Started</h1>
<p>Vancouver Art Gallery: Monsters in My Head by Otani workshop and Written in Clay by John David Lawrence Currently on view in the first-floor galleries of the Vancouver Art Gallery are two exhibitions: the solo show Monsters in My Head by Japanese artist Otani Shigeru (Otani Workshop), and Written in Clay, an exhibition of American musician, social activist, and collector John David Lawrence’s private ceramic collection. The gallery space is divided through the center, creating two symmetrical wings that establish a subtle dialogue between the two spaces, two independent realms that mirror and respond to each other. Notably, both exhibitions convey a sense of revelation and externalization through their titles, and both are intimately connected to the medium of ceramics, rendering their relationship interestingly ambiguous. ⸻ I. Monsters in My Head “What if monsters were companions to guide us rather than creatures to fear? （Otani, 2025)” Otani opens his curatorial statement with this perplexing question, immediately drawing the viewers into a surreal, dreamlike atmosphere filled with innocence and wonder, it’s a tone that defines the entire exhibition. Monsters in My Head invites viewers into the artist’s inner world of imagination and memory, a landscape woven from myth, material, and emotion that are “strange yet deeply familiar.” The exhibition is divided into two sections. The first features works produced during Otani’s 2024 Deer Lake Artist Residency at the Shadbolt Centre for the Arts in Canada, including paintings and sculptures inspired by the natural environment and folklore of the Pacific Northwest. The second section juxtaposes ceramic sculptures with organic materials such as tree stumps, moss, and branches, evoking a wonderful landscape between reality and fantasy. While he draws inspiration from the ceramic traditions of Japan’s Awaji Island, the works are also shaped by Otani’s own intuitive experimentation, underpinned by a worldview grounded in Japanese animism—the belief in the sentience of all things. ⸻ The First Gallery The first gallery appears somewhat cluttered, even unbalanced: four monumental mixed-media paintings are all at one side, while the opposite side is populated with smaller ceramic sculptures and illustrations. The center of the room, covered in industrial gravel, resembles a “playground” which displays a few larger ceramic works. Otani’s personal style is very recognizable, yet it carries the distinctive undertones of kitsch inherent in contemporary mass culture. The branded, reproducible, cute (kawaii), dreamy, anthropomorphic, and gender-ambiguous figures that fulfill all Western fantasy of “Japanese art.” On one hand, this reflects the aesthetic paradigm established by anime and illustration within East Asian mass culture across generations; on another, it demonstrates how ‘simple viewing’ provides psychological safety for viewers. Viewers can relaxingly exist within the familiar ‘landscape’ while gender and aggression dissolve, and the monsters become guardians and collaborators and mediators between humanity and nature instead of something horrible. This aligns closely with the artist’s stated philosophy. The works are widely various in theme, form, and technique, it’s like an open studio more than a seriously curated exhibition. Some of the pieces explore fleeting emotions of adolescence—loneliness, wonder, longing, and hope (expressed in small illustrations accompanied by handwritten texts). Others reflect on family relationships (embodied in the large paintings), while the sculptural series states “monsters” as metaphors for possibility of inviting new visions into reality. Together, these works create an atmosphere that is playful but a bit ‘blue’, setting an extreme contrast with the following gallery. ⸻ The Second Gallery The second gallery is imbedded with philosophical depth. In a dim environment, with only few beams of light cast on the sculptures, drawing viewers into a Baroque-like theatrical space that violently contrasts the brightness of the first room. As mentioned earlier, these works created during Otani’s Deer Lake residency incorporate locally foraged materials such as branches, stumps, and moss to construct a woodland setting, in which “monsters” dwell as if naturally born from the earth and stumps. This simple juxtaposition reflects an interaction between humanity and nature, demonstrating how the artist situates himself within nature in a transcendent, spiritual, and generative way. Here, the sculptures of the monsters functioning as projections of the artist’s unconscious archetypes. Though Otani persists the ‘kawaii’ aesthetic, under the subtle lighting, its sweetness transforms into quiet contemplation. These works abandon linear narrative or explicit communication, instead, it invites viewers to experience animism directly—to feel the presence of all things has spirit. In doing so, Otani avoids the instability of semiotics caused by linguistic and cultural difference, translating cultural discourse into lived experience. </p>
<p>The two spaces are connected by an archway woven from dried branches, evoking the principles of wabi-sabi—a reflection of Otani’s personal philosophy of living in harmony with nature. ⸻ Cultural Critique Visitors will first see the large English title Monsters in My Head once they enter the gallery, beside which the much smaller Japanese translation appears. The hierarchy between the two languages is not merely a visual design choice but a revelation of curatorial ideology. Monsters in My Head exemplifies the postcolonial dilemma of non-Western cultures that postcolonialism itself is a postmodern illusion grounded in Western ideology. This dilemma stems partly from the legacy of power structures of the Industrial Revolution and colonialism. Yet “the West” is not simply a geographical or political center—it has become deeply internalized as the foundational grammar of human thought, the epistemological structure underlying knowledge, law, art, philosophy, and education. It functions as the very medium of thought through which the subjectivity is constructed. The formal language, theoretical framework, and grammar of Monsters in My Head are all inscribed within a Western paradigm, replacing Japanese culture to the position of the object being spoken about. This dilemma is not only the result of collusion of power institutions, but also of the West’s absorptive capacity—its ability to appropriate through the rhetoric of inclusivity. Imagine how western discourse incorporates Otani with the gesture of being ‘neutral’ and ‘inclusive’. Since Romanticism, the Western avant-garde has built a tradition of rebellion so expansive that by the time of Duchamp’s Fountain, it had achieved an almost limitless capacity for inclusion. Such inclusivity, however, extends not only to avant-grade experimentation that rooted in tradition, but also to industrial mass culture and postcolonial global hybrid culture—everything can be subsumed under the Western narrative. For non-Western artists, this creates a paradox: the act of narrating one’s culture is itself also a Western gesture. Every culture that believes it is asserting self-determination is, in essence, negotiating its visibility through Western frameworks. The West is like a monumental Joseph Beuys, invites “the Other” to participate in a collective art project titled Postcolonialism—graciously recognizing the Other as artist, but automatically retaining authorship. ⸻ II. Written in Clay In intense contrast to Monsters in My Head, Written in Clay operates from an entirely different cultural position. It also has two sections: the first features over 200 ceramic works collected by John David Lawrence since 1990; the second transforms the exhibition into an interactive space where visitors are invited to design and create their own ceramics. ⸻ The First Gallery This section adopts the appearance of a museum display, meticulously presenting Lawrence’s massive collection that states the history and evolution of ceramic culture in British Columbia throughout the twentieth century. Works by key artists are hung on the walls, while the central space visually maps the province’s progression from functional pottery to sculptural experimentation. The exhibition captures the emergence of artistic self-awareness among BC potters—echoing the creative awakening of the Renaissance and Enlightenment eras, and radiates a sense of historical vitality. ⸻ The Second Gallery The second section extends the audience’s engagement from viewing to experiencing. By transforming an academically vigorous, serious museum setting into a playful and entertaining environment, the exhibition blurs the boundaries between art, life, and recreation, fostering community connection through creative experience. ⸻ Cultural Critique Written in Clay foregrounds local and marginalized artistic histories, functioning like a museum archive that revisits narratives overlooked from the mainstream art history. It raises critical questions about collection and visibility: Who has the right to be collected? Who has the right to be exhibited? Does collection precede discourse—or does discourse legitimize collection? In this tension, the exhibition blurs the boundary of discourse between artists and collectors. By exhibiting under the collector’s name, the exhibition reveals how curatorial framing transforms meaning—each object is catalogued, numbered, and presented as part of the continuity of history and integrity of collection. The artists’ intentions and emotions are subordinated to curatorial chronology. Thus, the artworks become illustrations of history rather than independent creations as their autonomy compromised by the very act of institutional display. Especially for pieces being shown publicly for the first time, their legitimacy as individual artworks is almost erased. Ultimately, Written in Clay demonstrates how collection and curation negotiate with history, questioning the boundaries between artifact and artwork, individual and collective, visibility and erasure. ⸻ III. Conclusion While Monsters in My Head and Written in Clay operate from divergent cultural standpoints, but both respond to history and tradition in their own ways. Yet, when juxtaposed with the pure local authenticity of Written in Clay, the Monsters in My Head exhibition further illuminates the non-purity of Eastern cultural expression under global art discourse. Together, the two exhibitions articulate the Vancouver Art Gallery’s dual ambition of reillustrating marginalized narratives while maintaining international relevance. However, they also expose the central paradox of postmodern curatorial practice that only the forms of art that can be interpreted, translated, and absorbed within Western discourse are permitted visibility. This is not merely a limitation of human language or experience—it is the enduring legacy of history and power.</p>
